- **Gross Profit** = Revenue - COGS
- **Gross Margin %** = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100

#### Inventory Metrics
- **Inventory Value** = SUM(quantity × average_cost)
- **Slow-Moving** = Products with stock > 3× sales rate
- **Inventory Turnover** = COGS / Average Inventory

#### AR Metrics
- **Outstanding AR** = SUM(total_amount - amount_paid)
- **Overdue %** = (Overdue Amount / Outstanding AR) × 100
- **Days Overdue** = Current Date - Due Date

## 🤖 Phase 3: AI Executive Advisor

### Advisor URL: `/ai-advisor`

**This is a Rule-Based Analytics Engine** - not machine learning. It applies business rules to your data to generate insights.

### How the Rules Work

#### 1. Executive Summary
Real-time KPI aggregation with trend calculation:

```
Revenue Change % = ((Current Month - Previous Month) / Previous Month) × 100
Margin % = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
Slow Inventory % = (Slow Moving Count / Total Products) × 100
```

#### 2. Insight Engine Rules

| Insight | Trigger Rule |
|---------|--------------|
| Revenue Trend | `ABS(revenue_change) > 5%` |
| Margin Change | `ABS(margin_change) > 2pp` |
| Slow Inventory | `slow_moving_pct > 15%` |
| Overdue AR | `overdue_count > 0` |
| Customer Concentration | `top_customer_pct > 25%` |

#### 3. Risk Detection Rules

Each risk has a **score (0-100)** and **level**:

| Risk | Calculation | Threshold |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Customer Concentration** | `top_customer_pct × 2` | ≥50 = High |
| **Slow-Moving Inventory** | `slow_pct × 3` | >10% = High |
| **Overdue Receivables** | `critical_pct × 2` | ≥50 = High |
| **Supplier Dependency** | `top_supplier_pct × 2` | ≥50 = High |
| **Margin Compression** | `decline × 10` | >30 = High |

**Risk Levels:**
- Critical: Score ≥ 75
- High: Score 50-74
- Medium: Score 25-49
- Low: Score < 25

#### 4. Opportunity Detection Rules

| Opportunity | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| High-Growth Customer | `revenue > avg_revenue × 1.5` |
| Fast-Moving Product | `units_sold > avg_units_sold` |
| High-Margin Product | `margin > avg_margin × 1.2` |
| Efficient Supplier | `lead_time < avg_lead_time` |

#### 5. Recommendation Rules

Recommendations are triggered by detected issues:

| Issue | Recommended Actions |
|-------|---------------------|
| Slow inventory > 5 items | Launch promotions, reduce purchases, bundle products |
| Critical AR > 0 | Contact customers, escalate accounts, review credit terms |
| Margin declining > 5% | Review pricing, negotiate with suppliers, focus on high-margin products |
| Customer concentration > 30% | Develop upselling, increase marketing, diversify customer base |

#### 6. Forecasting Rules

Simple moving average with trend factor:

```
Forecast = (3-Month Moving Average) × (Trend Factor)
Trend Factor = (Last 3 Months Avg) / (Previous 3 Months Avg)

Confidence:
- 12+ months data: 90%
- 6-11 months data: 70%
- < 6 months data: 50%
```

#### 7. Daily Executive Brief

A snapshot combining:
- Top insight from data analysis
- Highest priority risk
- Most important recommendation
