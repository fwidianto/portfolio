## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading

**Problem**: Images show broken icons

**Solution**: 
- Verify all images are in the `Assets/` folder
- Check file path references in HTML (e.g., `Assets/filename.png`)
- Ensure no spaces in file paths are causing issues

### CSS Styles Not Applied

**Problem**: Page appears unstyled

**Solution**:
- Verify `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags in `<head>`
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Ensure CSS files are in the correct `CSS/` directory

### JavaScript Not Working

**Problem**: Interactive features don't work

**Solution**:
- Open browser developer console (F12)
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify external script sources are accessible

### Investment Dashboard Not Loading

**Problem**: Charts and data sections empty

**Solution**:
- This feature requires internet connection to fetch from Google Apps Script
- Check browser console for CORS or fetch errors
- The Google Apps Script endpoint must be publicly accessible
